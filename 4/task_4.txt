Operation should return value 128. The reason for this behavior is overflow of the char variable. Char always stores 1 byte of data (can encode 2^8=256 symbols). The right side of the assignment operator is too big to fit in char. The multiplication and overflow can be interpreted as follows:
' ' * 12 = 32 * 12 = 384
384 - 256 = 128
32 is the value of space in the ASCII table.
